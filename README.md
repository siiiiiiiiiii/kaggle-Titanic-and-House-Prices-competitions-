In the Titanic and House Prices competitions, I achieved 78.5 % accuracy (ranked 2,300) and 0.12507 RMSE (ranked 643), respectively. I realized that for small datasets, deeply understanding the data and crafting high‑quality features is more effective than blindly using complex neural networks or stacked models. This experience helped me develop a more pragmatic approach to machine learning.
